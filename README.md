# Iris Species Classification

## Project Overview

This project aims to classify iris flowers into three species based on their sepal and petal measurements. We use the classic Iris dataset, which was introduced by R.A. Fisher in his 1936 paper "The Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems".

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each of the three iris species. Each sample has four features:

1. Sepal Length (cm)
2. Sepal Width (cm)
3. Petal Length (cm)
4. Petal Width (cm)

The target variable is the iris species, which can be one of:

- Iris setosa
- Iris versicolor
- Iris virginica
